"""HarnessGraphBinding ORM (models layer; ADR-029 §1).

The workspace↔harness binding — a many-to-many *curation* edge owned by the capability registry
(NOT an OHM manifest field, NOT a graph-substrate association). One row binds a ``kind:harness``
capability to a knowledge graph (workspace); it is a visibility/discovery association only and
grants NO data access and changes NO execution route (ADR-029 §2, hard invariant).

Org-scoped (``organisation_id`` NOT NULL — ADR-006/ORG002), stamped from the caller's principal,
never a body field (ORG001). ``harness_capability_id`` FKs the registry's own
``capability_descriptors`` ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` (a deleted harness removes its bindings in-service,
ADR-029 §4). ``graph_id`` is a plain UUID with NO cross-service FK — graphs live in
knowledge-graph-service (separate Alembic lineage; no cross-service FK); a graph
delete cannot cascade here, so dangling rows are tolerated and lazily skipped on read (ADR-029 §4).
``UNIQUE(harness_capability_id, graph_id)`` makes attach idempotent (the repository maps the
IntegrityError to an already-bound success). ``created_by`` is added explicitly (the base mixin only
gives ``created_at``/``updated_at``).

No ``from __future__ import annotations`` — SQLAlchemy resolves the ``Mapped[...]`` annotations at
mapper configuration, so they must be real types.
