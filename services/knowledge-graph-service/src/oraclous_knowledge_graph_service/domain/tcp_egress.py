"""TCP egress guard for USER-supplied DB hosts (domain layer — pure, no I/O except DNS).

A SQL ingest resolves a ``connection_string`` from the broker and then opens a RAW TCP connection to
its ``host:port`` (asyncpg / aiomysql). The existing HRS + CRS egress guards are HTTP(S)-URL guards
(they require an http(s) scheme via ``urlsplit``/``urlparse``) — a bare DB DSN (``postgres://…`` /
``mysql://…`` / a host:port) is NOT an http URL, so neither covers this raw DB TCP connection. This
module is the DECIDED "Option B" structural TCP check for that gap (Reza sign-off, #307).

The structural rules mirror the CRS MCP guard (blocked hostnames + suffixes + single-label-host
block + literal-IP classification) and add the HRS ``allow_private`` single-tenant mode, applied to
a ``host`` (no scheme) rather than a URL. BLOCK by default:

  * link-local 169.254.0.0/16 (incl. the cloud-metadata 169.254.169.254), IPv6 link-local
    (fe80::/10), AND the enumerated out-of-range cloud-metadata (IMDS) endpoints — notably the AWS
    IMDS-over-IPv6 ``fd00:ec2::254`` (a ULA, so NOT caught by the link-local block) — ALWAYS
    blocked, in either mode (``allow_private`` never relaxes them): no legitimate DB here, only
    SSRF into instance metadata;
  * loopback (127.0.0.0/8, ::1), RFC-1918 (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16), IPv6 ULA (fc00::/7);
  * the literal blocked hostnames (``localhost``, ``metadata``, ``metadata.google.internal``);
  * the internal suffixes ``.internal`` / ``.local`` / ``.localhost`` / ``.cluster.local``;
  * a single-label / bare-container hostname (``postgres``, ``db``) — an internal container name,
    not a real external server (which is an FQDN or a literal IP).

ALLOW a public host or public literal IP. The hostname is RESOLVED and EVERY resolved IP is
re-checked (a public name pointing inward is blocked). Fail-CLOSED: an unresolvable / ambiguous /
unparseable host is rejected.

In ``allow_private`` mode (single-tenant / dev — the flag mirrors the HRS egress ``allow_private``)
the loopback / private / ULA / blocked-hostname / suffix / single-label rules are RELAXED so a user
can ingest from a local or internal DB (``192.168.x``, ``localhost``, a bare ``postgres``); the
link-local / cloud-metadata range stays blocked in EITHER mode.

DNS-rebinding TOCTOU: this is a resolve-time check — a hostname that resolves to a public IP here
could resolve to a private IP at connect time. The fuller fix pins the resolved IP into the outbound
connection. :func:`validate_db_host` therefore RETURNS the validated resolved IP so the caller can
connect to that pinned address (host=<ip>) rather than re-resolving the name (the SQL connector does
exactly this — see ``domain/connectors/sql_connector.py``). This 3rd egress guard (HRS, CRS, now KGS
TCP) is a deliberate MIRROR, not a shared extraction: the HRS/CRS guards are http(s)-URL guards with
divergent rule sets, so a clean cross-service ``packages/`` extraction would have to reshape both —
too invasive for this slice. FLAGGED for a follow-up consolidation into a shared ``packages/`` net
util (see the PR body / #294).
